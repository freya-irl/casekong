### a HHKB-type case for the choc version of weteor's [kong](https://github.com/weteor/Kong) with a reworked PCB for RGB!

- featuring a 2mm metal top plate and a 2mm plate below the PCB

- LED diffusers for the top plate cutouts, internally

- slightly recessed USB C port

- the back has slightly recessed indents for bumpers

## details

- the PCB is held in by a ledge in the back and 2 screws in the front

- the top plate and switch plate are glued together and then held in with the switches, concealing any mounting hardware in the case

## PCB

- lightly reworked to add the SK6812 mini-e in the corners instead of switches

## getting the thing made/files

the bottom case is designed to be resin or MJF printed, same goes for the plate.  
the top plate and the PCB metal can be whatever is preferred (as long as it's 2mm thickness), i rendered it with a stainless steel look.  
i would recommend not using a clear acrylic for the top plate since that has to be glued to the switch plate, which will probably be visible in that case.  
the PCB is designed to be 1mm thickness, only that will fit into the case.
